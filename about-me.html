        <h2>Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Lykke! I'm a 21 year old graphic design and web development
          student at JTH, Jönköping, Sweden. I'm interested in art, graphic
          design, music, nature and cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in a little town called Värnamo, which is about 1 hour from
          Jönköping.
        </p>
        <p>
          I actually civics in highschool but chose an entirely different way to
          end up here. After highschool I worked several different jobs for 2
          years to gain some experience and have a better financial standpoint
          as I started studying. The most boring situation for me in an work
          environment is be where I would be at a point that I could not learn
          any more from the work I'm doing. Which is why I've switched jobs
          quite a few times. To work with something more creative is also
          something I really enjoy doing.
